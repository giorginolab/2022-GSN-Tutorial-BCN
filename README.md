# Materials for the MSI course, Master in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences, UPF.

The practice is based on the following paper:

> Giorgino T, Analysis libraries for molecular trajectories: a cross-language synopsis. Chapter 20 in:  Biomolecular Simulations: Methods and Protocols Edited by M. Bonomi and C. Camilloni (Springer, ISBN 978-1-4939-9608-7).  [Preprint here](https://github.com/giorginolab/analysis_libraries_chapter/).

and on the biological example from:

> Giorgino T, Mattioni D, Hassan A, Milani M, Mastrangelo E, Barbiroli A, et al. Nanobody interaction unveils structure, dynamics and proteotoxicity of the Finnish-type amyloidogenic gelsolin variant. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease. 2019 Mar 1;1865(3):648â€“60. [Journal version](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443919300109?via%3Dihub). [Preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07308).

## Interactive practice

We will use Google's Colab servers to try and solve the exercises
interactively. Colab will open the Python notebook contained in the
[practice](practice) directory and make it interactive. You may be
asked to login to Google and to accept the execution of code.

Note that if you open the *practice.ipynb* notebook in GitHub, the
notebook will look the same but will **not** be interactive. (If
GitHub displays the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?",
click Reload.) 

## Local execution

You may also checkout or download the notebook and open it in 
the Jupyter environment. Alternatively, you may copy-paste the
commands in an *ipython* interactive session.
